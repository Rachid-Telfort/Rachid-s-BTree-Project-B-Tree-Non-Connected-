# Rachid-s-BTree-Project-B-Tree-Non-Connected-
About:
	This project was one of three main projects that was assigned to me in my data structures class while I was attending Georgetown University. This project consisted of implementing a B-Tree (actualy a B+ Tree where the leaf nodes are not linked) using a Two-Dimensional array. Additionally, the Two-Dimensional array would simulate a hard disk drive in the sense that one would be able to search and manipulate entire sectors. I decided to revisit this project because I could not finish it during the semester that I took my data structures course in. I decided to revisit this project to finish it as well as learn more about the B-Tree data structure. I also decided to add extra features to the project that others would find interesting/useful. It took me about 1.5 months to finish this project mainly due to making the code more efficient as well as debugging. The projectâ€™s original creator is Bala Kayalansundaram, a professor in the Computer Science Department of Georgetown University.
  
Execution File Use:
	The execution file is menu driven. When one first opens it up they will be greeted by several prompts that welcomes them to the project. After the welcoming prompts, a menu prompt will appear showing the user the ways one could manipulate the B-Tree (This menu will reappear after every menu choice is processed). For choosing a menu choice to be processed, one first enters the number associated with the menu choice description and presses enter. This will cause the menu choice to be processed which may cause additional prompts to appear guiding you through the processing of the choice (In fact all prompts and menu choices can be processed in a similar way). I understand that these are very basic instructions on how to use the execution file. If one would like more clarification or has suggestions, please comment on the project page on GitHub or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
  
Source Code Use:
	The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions/questions relating to the source code, please comment on the project page or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
  
Final Notes:
	This version of the project is a B+ Tree where the leaf nodes are not linked. When I have the time, I will implement two more versions: One that is a B+ Tree where the leaf nodes are linked, and one that is an actual B-Tree where the records can exist in both the leaf and internal nodes.
	I hope that my fellow coders will find the source code helpful as well as gain valuable insight from it. If you have read this, thank you for looking at my GitHub page it is much appreciated.
